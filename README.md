BurritoHunter - Hackathon
=============

BurritoHunter is a GoogleMaps and Yelp API mashup that allows users to quickly build and save a list of places.  It is a collaborative effort with designer Mario C. Delgado.  BurritoHunter was created for BbMobile's 1st quarterly hackathon resulting in a 4th place finish!  And a $20 gift card for Peet's coffee.  The app, as is, only works on Android phones with API > 17.  Sorry, this was our first Hackathon, we really just wanted to have something to show during our 5 minute presentation.

A handful of people came up to us after the Hackathon to express their interest in seeing this app go live.  It was an easy decision for Mario and I to pursue this idea.  So we spent the next six months creating a production version of BurritoHunter.  You can check it out on the Google Play store here:
